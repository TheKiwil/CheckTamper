Application for Flipper Zero to control the tamper evident feature of ST Microelectronics HF (NFC) RFID chips, ST25TV02KC, and ST25TV512. The 02KC version provides enhanced security with password-protected access, whereas the 512 version allows access to the tamper state without a password.


## What is the tamper evident

A Near Field Communication (NFC) device with a "tamper evident" feature is designed to detect any attempt at unauthorized alteration or manipulation of its components or data. The term "tamper evident" translates to "preuve d'alt√©ration" in French.

In practice, this means that the NFC device is equipped with security mechanisms to detect if someone has tried to physically modify the device or manipulate the stored data. These mechanisms may include seals, sensors, or other specific devices that clearly indicate any tampering.

The primary goal of tamper evident in NFC is to ensure the integrity and security of information exchanged via NFC communication by ensuring that the device has not been compromised or altered maliciously. This is particularly crucial in sensitive applications where data security and trust in the device are paramount.
